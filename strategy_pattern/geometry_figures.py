#  You often work with the different geometrical figures and with their
#  parameters - the perimeter, area, and volume. You are tired of doing it
#  manually, so youâ€™ve decided to automate this process, and therefore you
#  need to write a particular program. In this program you should create
#  the class Parameters which will choose one of the few figures (the CIRCLE,
#  RIGHT TRIANGLE, SQUARE, RIGHT PENTAGON, RIGHT HEXAGON, CUBE) using the
#  choose_figure() method and will count the perimeter, area,
#  and volume with the help of the following methods:
#
#      perimeter() - returns the perimeter of the figure;
#      area() - returns the area of the figure;
#      volume() - returns the volume of the figure.
#
#  Also you have to create a class for each figure and use the Strategy
#  design pattern to solve this mission.
#  Every figure, except the cube, has the volume = 0.
#  If the result has no decimal places, you should return it as int(),
#  in other case - round it to the 2 decimal points.
